## Using Images

### get docker image

```
$ docker pull curlimages/curl:...insert tag...
```

### run docker image

```
$ docker run -it curlimages/curl:...insert tag... --version
```

### building and testing images

To build and test curl docker image
```
$ make all
```
which runs the setup (clean), build and test targets.

### scanning images

Security scan of resultant docker image
```
$ make scan
```
which uses trivis, anchore-engine, lynis and clamav.

One can also run a lint checker on dockerfiles
```
$ make lint
```

## Image design

* initial stage, build curl and then copy over to clean base image
* build static curl
* attempt to be idiomatic across image(s)
* running as curl_user is an explicit design decision
* multi arch is achieved using buildx support
